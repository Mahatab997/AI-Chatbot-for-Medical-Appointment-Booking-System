1. Introduction: 
   The rapid growth of healthcare services requires efficient medical appointment systems. Manual booking methods are time-consuming and inconvenient for patients. This project proposes an AI-powered chatbot using Artificial Intelligence    (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate medical appointment booking and provide basic hospital information through natural language interaction. 
2. Problem Statement:
   Traditional medical appointment systems depend on manual booking, which is slow, inefficient, and error-prone. This increases staff workload and limits patient access outside office hours, creating the need for an automated and       
   intelligent solution.
3. Objectives

    •	To develop an AI-based chatbot for medical appointment booking

    •	To understand and process patient queries using NLP techniques

    •	To allow users to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments

    •	To suggest doctors based on department or patient requirements

    •	To provide basic hospital and appointment-related information efficiently

4. Proposed System:

   The system uses an AI chatbot to understand user queries and manage appointments. It identifies intents like booking, rescheduling, or canceling, extracts required details, updates the database, and provides instant confirmation.
6. Features:

    •	Medical appointment booking

    •	Appointment rescheduling and cancellation

    •	Doctor selection based on department

    •	NLP-based chatbot interaction

    •	Secure handling of patient and appointment data
